Elements of Programming [ data , func ]:
- primitive expression
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

simple-entities > compound-elemenst > units

two kinds of elements : 
    data(stuff)
    function(descriptn of rules) 

enviroment (memory, context, build in abstractions)

[functions]
function name(parameters) { return expression; }
function-expression (argument-expression)

    applicative-order vs norman-order

[conditional's]
predicate ? consequent-expression : alternative-expression

    predicate : operators/functions.return + expressions.evaluate = true/false

computer-function are much effective than mathematical functions
    declarative-knowledge (math-func: describing properties of things, "what is") 
    imperative-knowledge  (comp-func: descriving how to do things, "how to")


"functions as black box abstractions"
    bounds, scopes ....

"functions and the processes they generate"
