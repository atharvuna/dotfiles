what is computing ??
>> 3 main dimensions of computing:
    theoritical-foundation:
        computing is fundamentally rooted in the toc, which examines what can be computed and how efficiently it can be done
        algorithmic-complexity --- resources-required[time, space]
        automata theory and formal languages
    practical-applications:
        [software-development, hardware-design]; layers/algos/structures to solve specific problems
        programming-paradigms, data-management-techniques, system-architecture
    inter-disciplinary connections:
        computing is inherently interdisciplinary[ai, hci, quantum, edge, signal-processing]

theoretical foundation major branches:

        automaton (automata):
        : mathematical model of computation that describes a system capable of processing inputs to produce outputs based on defined rules and has the ability to transition between different states according to certain inputs
            components: states, input-alphabet, transition-func, initial-state, final-state
            types: 
                finite-automata(DFA, NFA):
                - process regular-languages
                pushdown-automata:
                - extends finite-automata by incoporating a stack of memory
                - process context-free-languages
                turing-machines:
                - consists of an infinite tape and a read/write head
                - process recursively enumerable languages and define the limits of what is computable
